# Kali Linux Setup using Vagrant 
    
Kali Linux is installed on the VM after vagrant brings it up. Currently, all the tools gets installed. There should be a way to build the image from scratch installing only specific tools and not using insecure defaults (keys, password).  

ðŸ’€ Change the default vagrant user's password for all the boxes once they are created.

## Project Structure

```bash
\d\multi-k8s$ tree .
.
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ Vagrantfile     Contains global vars like IP, VM related config, versions of software 

0 directory, 2 files
```
